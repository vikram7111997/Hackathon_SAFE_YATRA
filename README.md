# Hackathon_SAFE_YATRA

This is the repo for my prototype app named 'Safe_Yatra' which i made as a digital software solution for the problem statement of 'passenger security' given under the Smart India Hackathon 2018 Competition.

This project contains the prototype or the Beta version app of my team's digital software solution (developed by me) to the National level goverment organized competition known as the Smart India Hackathon 2018 in which we choose the problem statement named the 'Passeneger Security' which was under the 'Railway Ministry Dept'
